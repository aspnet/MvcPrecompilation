The Razor syntax provides a fast, terse, clean, and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML to create dynamic web content. This repo contains tooling that allows compilation of MVC Razor views as part of build and publish.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
