The Razor syntax provides a fast, terse, clean, and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML to create dynamic web content. This repo contains tooling that allows compilation of MVC Razor views as part of build and publish.

## Installation and usage

### Referencing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation` package
* If you're targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 or higher on netcoreapp2.0, a reference to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation` package is added by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` and you do not need to explicitly reference it.
* For desktop targeting projects or projects targeting ASP.NET Core 1.x, add a package reference to the appropriate version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation` in your project:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation" Version="1.1.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Enabling view compilation
View compilation as part of publishing is enabled by default if you're referencing the Web SDK (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`) that ships with .NET Core 2.0 or later versions. For older versions, add the `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` property to your project:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <MvcRazorCompileOnPublish>true</MvcRazorCompileOnPublish>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Alternatively, you may wire up the `MvcRazorPrecompile` target to a build event:
```xml
 <Target 
    Name="PrecompileRazorViews" 
    AfterTargets="Build"
    DependsOnTargets="MvcRazorPrecompile" />
```

## Options

Some aspects of view compilation can be configured by editing the project:

* `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish`: Setting this to `false` turns off all functions of view compilation that are enabled as part of publishing.

* `MvcRazorExcludeViewFilesFromPublish`: Enabling `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` prevents .cshtml files from being published. This option disables this behavior. 
Note: ASP.NET Core Mvc does not support updateable precompiled views. Any modifications to published cshtml files will be ignored if a precompiled view is discovered for that path.

* `MvcRazorExcludeRefAssembliesFromPublish`: Enabling `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` causes the target to prevent the `refs` directory from being published. This option disables this behavior.
Note: Setting this option is useful if your application is using a mix of precompiled and runtime compiled views.
    
* `MvcRazorFilesToCompile`: An item group that specifies view files to compile. By default this includes all .cshtml files marked as content.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
